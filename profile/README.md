Welcome to the TournamentTools GitHub organization! This repository hosts the tools, resources, and projects related to our CompSaber platform, and user-hosted TournamentTools-kit.

The GitHub Org is split into two. 
- **TournamentTools**
- **CompSaber**

## TournamentTools
> [!IMPORTANT]
> TournamentTools V2 is yet to be released.
> We have no time-frame for this, as We're focused on CompSaber.
> 
> TournmamentTools will release shortly after CompSaber's release, as CompSaber mainly will be using TournamentTools' systems.

A premade system, that allows You to self-host an overlay + a general tournament management-system to handle players/matches, without having to code anything.

> [!NOTE]
> You will have to change images and assets, to make it more suited for Your tournament

## CompSaber

> [!IMPORTANT]
> CompSaber is yet to be released.  
> We're aiming for somewhere in Q1 of 2025 being the earliest, with early Q4 being the goal, but We will **not** make any promises.

A cutting-edge tournament-platform, that aims to take the general tournament-scene to a higher level.  
Everything is hosted through CompSaber, meaning that You won't have to host any files locally.

Simply contact the CompSaber team, so We can get You started.
